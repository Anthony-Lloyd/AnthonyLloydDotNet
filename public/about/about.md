## About Me
At home, my greatest motivation comes from my family—my wife Kaytlan and son Mason. I am deeply committed to being a reliable provider, a role model, and a strong leader. Accountability, reliability, and leadership are the core values I uphold in both my personal and professional life.

With a strong background in logistics and a deep passion for technology, I bring hands-on experience and a solution-oriented mindset to the IT field. In my current role as a forklift driver, I specialize in process optimization and problem resolution, ensuring that operations run smoothly and efficiently. While I have built a solid foundation in technology, I am driven by a desire to grow further within the IT sector and become a well-rounded professional in the field.

### Continuous Learning & Certifications
I am committed to ongoing self-improvement through practical projects and formal education. My home lab allows me to experiment with new technologies, and I am pursuing an IT diploma to formalize my knowledge. This combination of hands-on experience and certification will support my goal of advancing in IT.
